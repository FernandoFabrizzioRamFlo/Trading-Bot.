# Trading-Bot

## Objective
Build a self-driven trading bot to run 24/7 on a Raspberry Pi with low maintenance.

## Description
This project aims to create an automated trading bot using FastAPI and SQLite as the backend, with a lightweight React/Tailwind frontend. The core bot will implement trading strategies, optionally enhanced with ML and public LLM APIs like ChatGPT, to assist in decision making.

The Raspberry Pi will serve as the hosting platform for cost efficiency and continuous operation. A secure dashboard will allow monitoring trades, profits, and bot status in real-time.
